          I am Connor Wallace. I am a 23 year old, recently graduated social
          sciences student who is looking to advance their career in the tech
          industry. I hold a major in Historical Studies, Psychology and English
          Literary Studies. I began learning to code in ernest during my final
          year of undergraduate study through online resources and it has
          electrified my life.
        </p>

        <p id="bioPara2" class="bioPara">
          I enjoy learning skills to enrich my life. I bring this energy to
          learning any new skill or refineing and re-inventing old ones. This is
          present in my coding, essay writing, tutoring, fencing, gaming, guitar
          playing, and cooking (the furthest from refinement). I find particular
          satisfaction in learning to communicate effectively with people. I am
          invigorated by teaching and learning from others. At the same time is
          best.
        </p>

        <p id="bioPara3" class="bioPara">
          I want to have satisfying employment which will allow me to support my
          loved ones. I hope start a family with my partner in the future. I
          want to have enough time to spend with my family and grow with them.

        <p id="educationPara1">
          My undergraduate degree in historical studies consisted of gathering
          and synthesising information from various credible sources to make a
          strong argument regarding a topic. Understanding the effect of
          historical narrative and historical models was also taught. English
          literary studies focused on understanding the effects of words and the
          meaning of these effects. I wrote essays which argued about the
          effects of words with regards to their contexts. These were with
          regard to sound, structure of a text, reference etc. Psychological
          studies was mostly rote learning on information regarding psychology.
          Particular attention paid to lower-income contexts. Assignments
          included literature reviews, qualitative research assignments (this
          included conducting interviews with ethical approval), statistical
          calculation for significance and writing argumentative essays based on
          evidence gathered from research papers and other academic resources.
        </p>
        <p id="educationPara2">
          My programming education has consisted of learning the basic rules of
          a language and slowly building up to larger and larger projects after
          learning what is needed for them. This has been common across the 2
          python courses I completed. After learning about user inputs, for
          loops and while loops I was able to build a
          <a href="https://github.com/Nerrotok/Xs-and-Os" target="_blank"
            >naughts and crosses game</a

          After learning about abject oriented programming I was able to build a
          <a href="https://github.com/Nerrotok/black-jack" target="_blank"
            >black jack game</a
          >. After learning how to intergrate python with SQL I could build
          database centered apps like
          <a
            href="https://github.com/Nerrotok/Student-management-app"
            target="_blank"
            >a student management system</a

            Tutoring at Chapel Lane Academy (2023-Present)
          </p>
          <p>
            I tutor high school students either at the company's location or
            online via zoom. I have tutored in geographical sciences and english
            home language. The job involves arranging times with the student
            and/or parents to have a session on a weekly basis. Then we ask what
            outcomes the parent and child are hoping to achieve and setting out
            a plan to make these outcomes achievable. Some students have
            difficulty in some areas that prevent them from achieving their
            goals. In these cases it is best to practice improving these areas.
            Some students have a weaker foundational understanding of a subject,
            this either needs to be directly addressed (rebuilding foundational
            aspects) or (if it is too late to effectively strengthen the
            foundation before exams) teach skills and methods to get the best
            mark possible without having a solid foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            After tutoring a student we were able to bring their mark up from
            low 50s to middling 70s in English. This was achieved mostly through
            attention being paid to the method in which they answered questions
            and developing confidence in their ability to answer questions
            through practice.

            During lockdown I was asked to become a junior moderator for a
